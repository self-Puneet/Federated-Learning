let me give some overview of all the projects I have ever did till now. 
1. particle physics (https://github.com/Self-nasu/Particles-Dynamics-Simulator) 
    - simulated the motion and every dynamic aspect of motion of a system of particle in a isolated system. 
    - using python NumPy arrays and 2d and 3d visualization using graph plotting libraries.
2. easyAI - a python open source library which i have initiated to provide easy way of plotting graphs for visualization, generating random data, creating models and other machine learning related stuff. but did only graph related stuff only.
3. learned machine learning with a very good grip over it. understood the working of models like nural network cnn. and done a mathematical machine learning course on NPTEL.
4. HandFlow (https://github.com/self-Puneet/Handflow-Android-App)
    - this project is a team project we are doing for home devices automations using android app, providing voice assistant feature for controlling them in the app and Main selling feature we can control the devices through a set of gesture we have already decided. 
    - so i helped in gather a 6gb dataset of hand gestures 
    - training the model using media pipe
    - helped in writting research paper for our work
    - trained the same model using different other image classification models like mobilevnet, yolo
    - done comparision and of different modelsusing visulization tools of python
    - also worked with firebase realtime database where we are managing devices status.
    - made a app using flutter app
        - which can control devices using buttons
        - worked to access and control firebase realtime database using flutter apps.
        - have added voice assistant through whcih on a given speech command we can change the status of devices. and thus learned how to do so in flutter using different libraries.
    - made a architecture (system design) of our product for second phase development of same from frontend to backend to hardware ESP32.
5. Sports-Management-System
    - this project was also a team project. however i didn't contributed much in this project.
    - but i have done firestore database part of this project.
        - have made the data structure of what collections and docuemnts going to look of firestore db.
        - managed each other thing like bulk feeding of data of client into it and manging that data through python scirpt time to time.
    - also did analysis part of whole of a analysis panel of the website (https://github.com/self-Puneet/ERP-Analysis)
    - made a object oriented python programme for understanding and getting a good grip on python and object oriented programming of this sports management system in whcih i also learned how to access firestore db in python. (https://github.com/self-Puneet/Sports-Management-System)
    - also hosted a python script on railways which daily exports the data from firestore db and transform it to excel file and saves that excel file in my google drive account fore records purpose.
6. BioCluster (https://github.com/self-Puneet/BioCluster-Tool)
    - this was a solo project. for developing a website using flutter whcih could take some protein sequences could found similarity matrix between them and then drow different visualization like 3d gaussian distribution curve, dendrogram, and a confusion matrix for clustering of given list of sequences into similar sequences. 
    - made a python backend using flask
        - which used bio informatics realated library to find the confusion matrix
        - matplotliba nd other libraries for visualizations.
        - api points which my frontend requeire
        - clustering of sequences using anglomerative clustering algorithm
    -  flutter web app
        - for the same with good ui and ux with ability to download and upload file related to sequneces of proteins.
        - also hosted the frontend part on netlify and is live. 
        - did api calls and dynamic data manging at frontend and well conected to backend.
7. eventsphere 
    - this is a event management system which is again a team work in which i was assigned thte job to make a flutter mobile app. at the same time our backend developer was working too for it.
    - i learned many things important in perspective of creating a frontend
        - routing using go routing, nested and dynamic routing, routign observer, routing guard for admin users etc.
        - worked on a view level architecture having 2 types of user visitor and admin while securing the routes of admin.
        - worked on navigations of many screens
        - worked with app daat and accesssing the databeing istored in appp data and all operation with. i was storing jwt token and user related info once login is done.
        - worked in jwt authentication and authorization at every api call and thus ensuring security
        - and obvouisly i have worked with dynamic data commmig from apis calls
        - have created well secured good login and regisration system.
    - from perspective of database also i have learned a lot
        - i am the one who have created mysql based relational database for this project
        - have also hosted that on our vm and made that work for backend to access it.
    - from perspective of backend also i have understood a lot
        - learned how backend works and how api calls are done and all stuff necessary to be known.
        - learned what is jwtauthentication and authoraization and security measures
    - other
        - github
            - learned to work on a team project with multiple team mates together by working on github organization
            - learned to use github teams
            -  learned to manage branches and all that stuff
        - team coordingation of a frontend developer and backend developer
        - kafka and its utility (understood its core thouggh not implemented)
        - docker containerization (specially for kafka) - udnerstood well about how to use docker its images and containers.
8. image to pdf convertor (https://github.com/self-Puneet/Image-to-PDF-Convertor)
    - have made a flutter app which could take multiple images from your galary and then convet them into pdf.
    - have learned about spheciall permissions like accessing images from the device memory and downloading a pdf file for user at desired the location.
    - user can also reorder the order of images in which they should look in pdf.
    - user can also determine the size of margin aroudnd each image in pdf.
9. python discord bot with mysql
    - made a python discord bot for managing our live discord server
    - whole data is stored on mysql database of ours.
    - both database and the live running python scirpt is hosted on our azure vm.
        - have managed the project thoough github to make it sync on local and on vm too.
        - made cicd pipeline to automate the deployement part after new updates.
        - learned how to use a vm along with its setup too.
    - learned to access mysql database through python script.
10. federated learning
    - working in python to udnerstand how can we aggreagate 2 very different deeplearning models into one without sharing data and thus protecting privacy of data at client side.
    - worked a lot in developing algorithm and understand some paper related to them.
    - in the course i extensivly used deep learning libraries like py torhc,tensorflow,numpy, pandas
    - worked with image and numerical data.
    - understood mathematical aspect too
    - played alot with weight matrices
11. other skills while whole journey
    - github
    - vm
    - hosting on netlify

    - fodler management of larger project
    - team working
